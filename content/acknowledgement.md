I acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the land on which I grew up and was educated, the Bunurong Boon Wurrung and Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung peoples of the Eastern Kulin Nation. I pay respect to their Elders past, present and emerging.

I also acknowledge that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have developed scientific theories of knowledge for thousands of generations. Read about it: [The First Astronomers](https://www.thefirstastronomers.com/).

Sovereignty has never been ceded. It always was and always will be, Aboriginal land.

I recognise the past atrocities against Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples of this land and that Australia was founded on the genocide and dispossession of First Nations people. I acknowledge that colonial structures and policies remain in place today and recognise the ongoing struggles of First Nations people in dismantling those structures. The struggle to seek justice, to remember and address this nationâ€™s past is ongoing and is a necessary requirement for individual and collective healing process.

I support the [Uluru Statement from the Heart](https://ulurustatement.org/) to achieve justice, recognition and respect for First Nations people and a referendum to enshrine a First Nations Voice in the Constitution. I accept the invitation contained in the Statement to walk together with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.
