Because I wrote it.[^1]

Furthermore, my motivation is to practice writing, and to develop my ability to convey scientific ideas of my own and others. A blog seems a safeish place to do this - not very likely to be read by all the people I really hope to reach but am currently hiding from in case they discover me and don't rate my opinions,[^2] but not entirely invisible either.[^3] 

I've read a number of blog posts which have given me joy, helped kindle my interest in science and technology, and inpsired various failured attempts at pragmatism. Hopefully something I write here will act as that spark for you or someone else.

My goals are to:

* gain practice in science communication  
&ensp; â†ª to the public  
&ensp; â†ª to funding committees or venture capitalists  
&ensp; â†ª to other scientists, such as colleagues and thesis assesors
* inspire someone, just as I have been inspired reading about other's journeys
