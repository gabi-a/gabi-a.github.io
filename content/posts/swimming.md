# My favourite swim exercise.
_Note: I'm not a swim coach!_

I love swimming, but don't always want to be in a swim squad. However, I find it can be hard to fully push myself when swimming without someone setting the agenda. Until I discovered the following exercise:

Swim as many 100 meter stints as you can on a 2 minute timer. If you arrive early, rest until the 2 minutes are up. If you arrive late, stop and take note of how many stints you did. That's it!
_Alternativitly: do this on 50 meter/1 min. If it's too much, increase the time, or, if it's too little, decrease it._

There are several benefits from this exercise:
1. It's really easy and rewarding to track progress from week to week: you'll find that whatever number of stints you are able to do at the start, within a few weeks that number will increase (maybe even double). Over 1 year I progressed from 10 to 30 - that's 3km at a pretty decent pace.
2. To continue increasing the number of stints, you need to improve your technique - and you'll have plenty of time to think about it while doing the laps. Breathing every 3-5 strokes (instead of every 2) has noticeable improvements when you're only just meeting the clock. You also develop good pacing and consistency.
3. It automatically scales with your current ability: the clock keeps you honest. I usually have some days that I don't feel so hot, so number of stints doesn't always stay constant or increase, but on average it definetly does.

Don't forget to do an _easy_ warmup (e.g. 200 m) before starting, and a cooldown as well.

_Note 1:_ As you get fitter, and are able to do more, eventually the training session starts to take a pretty long time. This might be time to decrease the clock time (e.g. 2 min -> 1.50 min).  
_Note 2:_ At the beginning, you may only be able to do a few of these. In that case do some other exercise so that the training session is worthwhile.
